### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### My (maybe) interesting public repositories:
- [Primitive Recursion Simulator](https://github.com/Ich5003/primrec): Allows you to simulate own primitive recursive functions, directly on the web.
- [Android CalenderView with Weekday Filter](https://github.com/Ich5003/CalendarView-WeekdayFilter): Fork of another Android Calender View, but allows you to only show specific days of the week.
- _Hopefully some more in the future..._

#### Languages
- Go
- Kotlin
- Typescript
- Java
- Python
